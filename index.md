# Bio331: Computational Systems Biology


In the era of high-throughput genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, we can now computationally explore biological processes at a systems level. Networks, or graphs, have become a dominant mathematical representation in this area of research. We will draw on the vast amount of established graph theory to learn about network models currently applied to biological systems. 

## About this syllabus

This syllabus is a public, searchable document that contains all of the details for this iteration of the course. It serves as a contract for the students taking Bio331 - if you take this course, you agree to abide by the policies described here. As the instructor, I commit to following this syllabus and administering it fairly and equitably. The main parts of the syllabus are:

- [Goals](doc/goals.md): the course goals and learning objectives.
- [Support](doc/support.md): the support systems offered in the course.
- [Policies](doc/policies.md): policies surrounding attendance, deadlines, collaboration, and generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT).
- [Schedule](doc/schedule.md): an overview of the course topics and assignemnts.
- [Assessment](doc/assessment.md): an explanation of how components in this course are evaluated and contribute to the final course grade.
- [Learning Environment](doc/environment.md): my commitment to making the classroom an inclusive learning environment.
- [Keys for Success](doc/tips.md): tips for succeeding in the course.

The final version of this syllabus will be set by the first day of class.  Any modifications during the semester will be noted in the [change log](doc/changelog.md) and will be communicated to the class via Moodle.
