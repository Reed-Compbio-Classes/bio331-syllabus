# Types of Work

Bio331 involves learning about two distinct themes -- biological networks at different scales and graph algorithms -- and how they can be combined to answer new biological questions. The work is graded on Missing/Partially Complete/Complete/Excellent (M/P/C/E), Present/Absent, or according to baseline work and extra work. Each assignment will clearly describe the criteria for success according to these assessment typess. More information is provided on the Moodle page. 

## Programming Assignments (30%)

There are approximately four programming assignments to be done outside of class. The programming labs are designed to help you start on these assignments (lab solutions will be released on Fridays), and they can be collaborative. You will complete these programming assignments in the first half of the semester. These are graded as M/P/C/E.

## Short Quizzes (20%)

There will be a take-home short quiz about each week's content (approximately 10 quizzes). These are intended for you to answer questions about the content of the lecture on your own (they are not collaborative). These are graded as M/P/C/E.

## Long Quiz (10%)

There will be a longer take-home quiz in the last two weeks of the semester that asks you to combine biological networks and graph algorithm topics we have learned to frame new questions. There will also be a reflection portion of the quiz based on the research project. These are graded as M/P/C/E.

## Engagement (10%)

There are three in-class activities and 14 labs that require student involvement. Attendance (or otherwise participating) in these activities is important for the class's learning goals. There will be ways to make up these components of the class if you miss them (see the attendance policy). These are graded as Present/Absent.

## Research Deliverables (30%)

You will work on a research project in the second half of the semester (either individually or in small groups). There are three types of deliverables for the research project: well-documented and correct code, a structured write-up describing your project, and a slide deck you will present during finals week. Each deliverable will have a set of required, "baseline" criteria to meet, as well as a number of "extra" criteria you might attempt. The Code, Write-Up, and Slides will each be marked as No Baseline/Baseline/Baseline + Extra. The grade is based on how many components are completed - see Moodle for more details.

Quizzes are completed individually; for all other assignments you can work with each other. Refer to the [policies page](policies.md) for more information.
