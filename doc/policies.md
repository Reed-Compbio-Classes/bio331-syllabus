# Course Policies

There are four policies for this course: one for [attendance](#attendance-policy), one for [deadlines](#deadline-policy), one for [collaboration](#collaboration-policy) (which is encouraged for the programming assignments) and one for the use of [generative AI](#generative-ai-policy) (which is discouraged).

## Attendance Policy

**Why Attend?** Attending the lectures and completing work during labs will put you in the best position to succeed in the course. Lectures will provide valuable information about the assignments, and labs will include some group work. Labs also offer time for me to provide guidance - they could be framed as small-group office hours working through problems together.  

**What's the Policy?**  Email me if you cannot attend lecture or lab.  There is no penalty for missing class or lab, but you may miss out on some discussion/worksheet components. If you are doing group work in lab, you have a responsibility to communicate with your group and catch up with work asynchronously. You are expected to review the missed material and meet with me if anything is unclear. 

There are some religious holidays and other events in the fall that might affect student attendance - please note these in your calendars and let me know if your attendance will be affected.

- October 2-4: Rosh Hashanah 
- October 11-12: Yom Kippur
- October 29 - November 3: Diwalai
- November 5: Presidential Election

If you miss multiple classes, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. Communication is key. Please see "Illness and Exceptional Circumstances" on the [support page](support.md) for more information about extended absences. 

### The Main Takeaway: There is no penalty for missing class, but attending and participating is expected and will set you up for success.

## Deadline Policy

The the programming, written, and research project assignments all have deadlines. Refer to the [schedule overview](schedule.md) and the [Moodle page](https://moodle.reed.edu/course/view.php?id=5621) for a detailed schedule with deadlines. The purpose of these deadlines is for you to complete the assignments at a steady pace throughout the semester. 

**Why Submit Work on Time?** The programming and written assignments are designed so that you are working on them after you have learned the relevant material in lecture and lab. If you are working on older assignments when another assignment is out, you might lose ground with the current coursework. 

**What's the Policy?** You must submit whatever work you have by the deadline, but there is no penalty for re-submitting programming and written assignments.  If you plan to resubmit your work, you must include a comment or statement to that effect and schedule a time to meet with me within one week of the submission in order to make a plan. These details will be provided on every written and programming assignment.

You have until Finals Week to re-submit all assignments (but note that the assignments are substantial enough that you cannot wait until Finals Week to complete them). 

### The Main Takeaway: Assignment deadlines are intentional, and you should submit your work by the deadline. You will be able to resubmit any of the work, but the class is not designed so you can submit _all_ the work at the very end of the semester.

## Collaboration Policy

This collaboration policity is specific to Bio331 only.

1. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on lab activities, class worksheets, and programming assignments is highly encouraged. When you collaborate, properly cite it in your work (see below). 
2. You can always look up how to use specific functions in Python, as long as you know what it is doing and you properly cite it (see below). 
3. You can always attend posted office hours and email me questions.
4. Do not use any graph library packages (e.g., `networkx` or `igraph`) unless directed. 
5. **You must write all of your own code for the programming assignments**. The research project can be done in groups, and you can also use graph library packages and other tools (see below).
6. Unless otherwise specified, **the written assignments must be completed on your own.**

Breaking the rules outlined in numbers 5-6 violates the [Honor Principle](https://www.reed.edu/honor_principle/) and may result in severe consequences.

### Citing Code

Code plagiarism is a real thing. Identical code is just as bad as copying and pasting entire paragraphs of an essay from another source - **always write your code in your own style.**  You have a lot of flexibility in naming variables, including print statements and comments in your code.

Just like when writing papers, there is a way to cite others' work in programs.  

1. If you write functions with other students in the class, add their names as comments at the beginning of the function, e.g., 

```
def file2graph(file):
   """
   Function to convert a file to a JSON graph.
   Written with Jane and Rob for Lab 5
   """
```

2. When in doubt, cite discussions with other students.  Here are some examples.

```
# I talked about the structure of this code with Marco
# Julie and I worked on the function post_network() together.
# I modified the convert() function from Lab 3
```

Remember, this type of collaboration is expected and encouraged! People who worked together should list each other as collaborators, since this will help us determine why some code might look similar.

3. For the Research Project assignment, you may use Python libraries and modules and borrow code from the web.  If you do this, add the following information as comments to your program  This pertains to both Python modules and StackOverflow-like queries.
1. Title and author information (if it exists)
2. URL
3. Brief description of what the code/module does.

*Warning:*  There are many incorrect programs floating around the internet.  Make sure that the code you use actually does what you want it to do.

### The Main Takeaway: Collaboration in class and on programming assignments is expected and encouraged! You should "cite" anyone you worked with on the programming assignments.

## Generative AI Policy

Generative AI is technology that is trained to generate text, images, or code from natural language prompts.  Two examples of generative AI that you might have seen before are ChatGPT (which returns text based on prompts) and GitHub Copilot (which returns code based on prompts).

The fact is, generative AI could do a pretty darn good job with some of the **programming assignments**. But the assignments are designed for _you_ to learn about graph algorithms, which can only happen if _you_ write the code. The [course goals](goals.md) of this class include implementing graph algorithms and applying them to biological networks - if you use generative AI to do that, you are not demonstrating that you can do this on your own.

The same goes for using generative AI for answering the **written assignments**. Generative AI might get some questions correct, but _you_ would not be demonstrating that you have learned the content. Don't worry - you will have opportunities to revise all asssignments in order to demonstrate your learning.

If you are feeling pressure to use generative AI to just _get the answer no matter what_, then come talk with me to strategize a way to help you learn the content without that pressure.

### The Main Takeaway: Generative AI should not be used in this class. But you should never feel the need to use it anyway.
