# Goals & Objectives

At the end of Bio331, you will be able to:

1. Represent biological systems as networks and understand how they are built from data.
2. Implement graph algorithms and apply them to biological networks (including simulated and real-world datasets).
3. Interpret the results of an algorithm run on a biological network.
4. Use technologies that enable collaboration and communication.
5. Learn how to work through a challenging research project and mark progress along the way.
6. Communicate work to a broad audience.

Bio331 satisfies the Group III and Group III-Data Collection and Analysis distribution requirements, and you can find the relevant group distribution learning outcomes in the [course catalog description](https://catalog.reed.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=7751).
